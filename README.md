## Stellar Streams and Dark Matter Subhalos
#### This code formulates a way to compare simulated dark matter subhalo data from Nadler 2023, with observed data of the positions of stellar streams. Data from Cecilia Mateu 2022 and Malhan et al. 2022 is compiled to develop the tajectory of stellar streams in the Milky Way.
